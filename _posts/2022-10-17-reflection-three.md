## Reflection

In his writing, the author Adam Kirsch addresses the issue of the digitization of the humanities, as he poses as a skeptic and resistor to what he thinks could be a detrimental transformation of humanities research. Kirsch is a traditionalist in the sense that he fears that the purest form of humanities research -- the study of humans, by humans -- may become lost with the intergration of technology and machine learning becoming a possibility to replace humanists in total. Part of this concern is regarding to the shift in skills required by humanists, where he believes the art of tangible reading may become replaced by new forms of distant reading and new skills such as programming become required of the humanist, which would create a shift from the fundamental identity of a humanist. 

One interesting idea that Kirsch presents is the analogy of the marketing of the digital humanities to the marketing of an Apple product, which he uses to introduce the concept that digital humanities is being marketed to push as a new revolution of the future of humanities. He states that the marketing tactic an Apple product, in which they push the notion that people should either follow the new wave by buying their product or fall behind in the realm of technology, is one that he believes is being used by digital humanists. As a result, he believes that humanists should stop and critique the digital humanities rather than be dragged into this so-called new aged "revolution" of humanities research. Another interesting idea that Kirsch presents is that traditional humanists, who are typically interested in art history and english, may not be interested or proficient in computer programming, a skill thought to be required of the modern-day digital humanist. This concept, although more debatable in the sense of its stereotypical nature, indicates his growing sense that humanists are being pulled away from their traditional line of work and diverted from their typical practices, which in turn could be detrimental to the preservance of traditional humanist research.

My question to Kirsch would be: Could there be a world where traditional humanist research can coexist with the digitization of humanist research? If so, what would that look like, and could that be more beneficial than complete shift toward the digital humanities?
