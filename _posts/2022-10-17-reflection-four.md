## Reflection

In this exploration, the author Gregory Crane brings attention to the importance of language translation reading in human development and our knowledge of history and culture. Within the reading processes of foreign language texts, he presents the disconnect between reading the translation and being able to actively comprehend and analyze the core meaning of the text due to issues in accuracy of the translation by machines or humans. In doing so, he also points out the lost art of intellectual "deep reading" techniques within readers, which constitutes of critical thinking and analysis processes that he believes are essential to fully understanding texts. As a result, he attempts to apply modern technologies such as machine learning in a way that can more effectively and accurately translate texts in various languages that would allow the human reader to more actively analyze and explore these texts in ways that would revert to "deep reading" processes.

One interesting idea that the author presents in reference to the defencies in human reading is the implementation of "smart texts," which he describes as texts that are equipped with "adaptive features" to support readers from various "linguistic and culture backgrounds." This development would create a new "emergent reading environment," which could have the potential of combining text with sound and images, representative of the culture and meaning behind the text. With this concept, these new aids and features that would ultimately enhance the readers experience and ability to analyze text. Another concept the author refers to in regards to the disconnects in translation is how certain ancient texts can often be more translatable and understood than modern foreign media. He explains this by referring to how texts such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, which were written hundreds of years ago, have had numerous translations into English, various dictionaries that explain the language, and have been deeply analyzed for thousands of years. In comparison, modern-day foreign media, such as Netflix TV-shows and YouTube videos, would be difficult for a viewer to understand and analyze if in a foreign language even despite of subtitles or dubbing due to the difference in quality of translation to that of an ancient text like the Iliad or Odyssey. 

One question I would have for the author is: How do you think these technological devices such as machine learning can be used to advance the analysis and understanding of new media such as television and audio in way that is similar to ancient texts and scriptures?
