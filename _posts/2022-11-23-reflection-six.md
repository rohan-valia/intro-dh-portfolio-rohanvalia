## Reflection

In this article, the author Chad Wellmon provides an exploration on how the development of "distant" reading and its critics have created the movement of the preservation of traditional "close" reading practices. In doing so, he tracks the history of the transformation of reading processes to ultimately understand where this traditional concept of reading as a sacred experience for humans has derived from and what has contributed to the loss of these traditional reading practices. This examination unveils the impacts of digital and computational reading, as the author presents the argument of critics that this form of reading "loosen[s]" the "attachment" to books and texts and indicates the "emotional attachment" that traditionalists believe that reading should provide. On the contrary, he provides insight on the perspective of how "distant" reading is a more transformative and critical form of reading that includes more quanitative analysis and various visualization techniques.

One interesting idea that is presented by the author is the sentiment within critics that modern technologies and machines are creating a "cultural collapse" of the humanities by digitizing books and texts. The author further writes how these critics believe that this transformation and catastrophe is a product of how new platforms such as the "Google Book Project" and the "Hathi Trust" in the 2000s began to digitize books from their previous print form on a massive scale. After this process, the author describes the "cultural shift" on how humans read on more digital forms, and also how the definition of reading evolved, which ultimately created resistance by traditional readers. Another idea presented by the author is from Hugh of Saint Victor based on Augustine's model of reading, which echoes the idea that reading is a sacred and holy experience that is also a form of meditation and exercise for the mind. Furthermore, the author describes Hugh's belief that reading always has a larger purpose, whether to pursue personal transformation or to accumulate knowledge, which adds to the significant value that reading holds to a human's wellbeing and development. Through this, the author is able to use the ideas of Hugh, Augustine, and other ancient figures as a representation of the historical value of reading and its impact on humankind to show how traditionalists aim to preserve the art of reading.

One question I would have for the author is: Can "distant" reading in the digital humanities also be a form of "close" reading given its various analytical benefits and its ability to help more deeply understand a text?
