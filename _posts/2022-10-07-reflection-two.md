## Reflection

In his narrative, the author Vannevar Bush emphasizes on the issue of how specialization during war has taken away from the ability to focus on scientific advancements in other realms of humanity. He raises awareness that science and technology are what can improve every aspect of human life and knowledge, which is what would ultimately propel the evolution of mankind. It is clear Bush's motivation and interest in analyzing and advancing the ways machines are built, used, and developed is what drives his narrative. He inspects the makeup of numerous existing scientific and technological devices, including past versions of the camera, telephone, and calculator, and highlights its function and importance in real world applications and analyzes the features of these instruments and points out their flaws and necessary improvements. He also brainstorms hypothetical devices that could become integral to human life in the future with detailed explanation on the development and utility of each device. Through these explorations, he demonstrates the need for future research and development in the scientific world and emphasize the value that these instruments could hold in the advacement of human knowledge and function.  

One idea that Bush brainstorms in his narrative is a physical machine that could apply logic within human affairs, which could theoretically be used in debate or argument. Having an instrument of this nature would be pivotal in the evolution of artificial intelligence and human behavior, which demonstrates the value that science has in human advacement and evolution. Another idea that Bush explores the phenomenon that the human brain selects by association rather than indexation, which stems from trails within the cells of the brain. With the brain's speed of memory, he believes that it can be applied to develop decision making within scientific devices. Thus, this concept of creating artificial intellegence using human wiring is a testament to his belief that technological machines and devices can become integral parts of human life and be tools for human advancement.

My question to Vannevar Bush would be: do you believe there could be negative repurcussions on humankind to the reliance and development of scientific machines and devices?
