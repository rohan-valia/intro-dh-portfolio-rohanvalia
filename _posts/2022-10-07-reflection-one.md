## Reflection

In their discussion of the humanities, the authors Eileen Gardiner and Ronald G. Musto address and debate the pros and cons regarding the digitization of data collection within humanitary research. The advantages of creating digital platforms for humanists appear glaringly positive. The ability to store and analyze information using online tools and applications makes organization much more efficient. The use of databases and spreadsheets allows a humanist to easily identify objects or documents and classify their characteristics. However, when doing so, a humanist must become proficient and diligent in how they store the data and characteristics they may need to collect. As a result, in this digitization process, a humanist could leave out important aspects of data or face technical issues that inhibit the safety in storage of the data. Thus, the authors remain cautious that in comparison to past analog methods, these digital forms of data storage could present new challenges and errors.

One integral idea that is highlighted in this document relates to the preservation of the authenticity of digitized material. The authors raise concern on how digitization can transform the way a tangible item is interpreted and analyzed, as the physical and material understanding of the item could be compromised. However, they note that with such digitization comes the advantage of making these items accessible to be inspected and manipulated using various technological tools that could  advance the understanding of the subject. Another important idea that these authors present regarding digital humanities is the notion that despite the advancements it presents in research and data collection, the prospect of analysis and interpretation remains the same as before. However, the authors pose the counterargument that there is a level of selectivity and analysis that must be present during the digitization process of recording and translating physical artifacts.

My question to the authors would be: how do humanists who have previously performed research with analog methods feel about the digitization of humanities? In what ways has it enhanced or hindered their ability to research and study the humanities?
