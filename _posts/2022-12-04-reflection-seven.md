## Reflection

In this blog post, the author Ben Dexter Cooley argues the importance of visual literacy and data visualization techniques in data literacy and data analysis. He establishes the distinction between data literacy and visual literacy by stating that data literacy refers to "understanding" the data, and visual literacy refers to the "presentation" of the data. He pleads that visual literacy should be used to tell the story to an audience in correspondence to the data and the overall narrative that is being presented. In his argument for an effective visual literacy, he brings attention the importance of utilizing visualization tactics such as the type of chart that is used and the color scheme, as well as the awareness of web user behavior and how users will interpret or interact with the data visuals. Through his narrative, he encourages data scientists to create both visually stimulating and accurate presentations of data in order to effectively convey the message to their viewers.

One interesting idea that the author presents is the analogy between visual literacy and music that is derived from data visualizer Hans Rosling, where data literacy is simply understanding the notes, while visual literacy is connecting notes to create an entire song.  The author furthers this analogy by creating a visualization of a sheet of music, where the data is symbolized by a single note, the insight is a small string of notes, the narrative is a larger string of notes, and the data story (aka the visual literacy) is the entire song with all the string of notes. Therefore, the author uses this analogy to convey the idea that visual literacy is being able to orchestrate and combine the data and the narratives that are derived in order to convey the overall story in a cohesive and complete manner. Another informative idea that the author presents is the "spectrum of Truth and Beauty," which explores the line between simplicity and complexity in regards to data visualization. Visualizations on the "Truth" side of the spectrum display the authentic data through tables and graphs as well as dashboards and reports. Visualizations on the "Beauty" side use more artistic techniques to display data such as interactive elements and data art. The author argues that data visualizations should be in the middle of this spectrum, being both informative and aesthetically pleasing. Ultimately, the author uses this spectrum to provide a better understanding on how data should be presented in order to be informative and digestable to its audience.

One question I would have for the author is: Should data scientists formulate and specify their data visualizations with a target audience in mind, or to be accessible and readible by all audiences? How would this impact the visualization technqiues that are employed?
