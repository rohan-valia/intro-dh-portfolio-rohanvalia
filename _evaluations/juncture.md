## Evaluation

The "Google Books Ngram Viewer" is a digital tool created by Google that allows users to visually and quantatively compare the occurance of n-grams within Google Books' corpus of books. An n-gram is a phrase from a text or speech that has a length of "n" words, and are typically analyzed for tasks corresponding to machine learning and natural language processing. For example, the phrase "Google Books" would be a 2-gram and "Google Books Ngram Viewer" would be a 4-gram. Once the user inputs their desired n-grams, the tool is able to create a visual line graph of each n-gram which plots the time period (in years) on the x-axis and the frequency of the n-gram (in percentage of all n-grams in Google Books' corpus). Through this graph, users are able to compare the relevance and prominance of their desired n-grams within all scanned texts in Google Books' corpus.

In its user interface, the tool provides various filters and options in addition to the search engine for the n-grams that allows users to further specify their search that tailor to their intended results or research purposes. Users are given the flexibility to select the date range (in years) of which the texts or books in the corpus were published, starting from 1500 until 2019. They are also given the option determine the language of the corpus of books (i.g. "American English," "British English," "French," "Chinese," etc.). They can also select whether or not the n-gram be search as case sensitive or not, which could expand the range of results if not selected. 

In an example, I inputed three 2-gram phrases into the Ngram viewer search engine: "Artificial Intelligence," "Machine Learning," and "Data Science." I selected the time range as 1900-2019, the language as "English," and did not choose for the search to be case sensitive. The graph demonstrated that all three of these ngrams have been essentially non-existent from 1900-1960. The frequency of "Artificial Intelligence" historically remained above the other two ngrams, as its curve began to slowly increase from around 1960-1980 while the other two curves remained flat. It then experienced a sharp increase from around 1980-1990, but symmetrically decreased from around 1990-1995, and stablized from about 1995-2015. However, most notably, all three ngaram curves experienced sharp increases from 2015-2019. The curve for "Machine Learning" only began to increase around 1985, and began to steadily increase until its eventually sharp increase in 2015, where it overtook "Artificial Intelligence" with the highest frequency. The curve for "Data Science" remained essentially flat until 2015, where it ultimately experienced its sharp increase from 2015-2019.

From this search, the tool generally displayed logical and inferable results in determining the frequency and occurance of the terms through history that would deem it useful. With the three ngrams that were used, which were related to new-age technological ideas and tools, the fact that they all experienced sharp increases in frequency in the last five years would generally indicate the vast and rapid advancements that have made in these areas, which appears accurate. Thus, in demonstrating the general timeline and "big picture" of certain ngrams, it is a useful tool for researchers, as it can lead to inferences and connections to important events or transformations that occured at certain points in history.

A strength of this tool is its simple user interface that makes the search engine easy to use, and the user can easily filter their search that allows to more precise or more broad depending on the research purpose. In addition, the interactive element of the graph that allows users to hover over different points on the line graph to see the exact frequency percentage at different points in time. However, a shortcoming of this tool is its potential for inaccuracy or broadness, which could lead users to create inaccurate inferences and could hinder their understanding of certain topics or ideas. Furthermore, it is unfortunate that the tool cannot provide context for certain changes in the graph of the ngram. A feature that could improve this tool would be attaching the link or name of the text or book that the ngram appears at certain time points, which could allow the user to dig deeper into certain events that occured and allow them to create inferences and broader connections for changes in the curves of the ngrams.
