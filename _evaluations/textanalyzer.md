## Evaluation
"Text Analyzer" is a digital tool created by JSTOR Labs with the goal to allow researchers to upload a document and subsequently receive related content within JSTOR's database. In its analysis, the tool is able to determine the most important terms and words that appear in a document and weigh each "prioritized term" on a scale to then match to relevant literature in JSTOR. Based on the results, the user can adjust the weighing scale for each term and also add new terms in order to better reach their desired content depending on their priority for certain terms.

In its search function, the tool prompts the user to upload any document with text from your computer, such as a scholar article or a school paper. It accepts files in almost every file type, including csv, html, jpg, pdf, png, txt, xlsx, and more. The user also is given the option to directly type or paste any original text into its search engine and upload it, which makes the tool even more dynamic and easy to use. To make it even more dynamic, the tool accepts text across various langugages, including Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic, and more. 

In an example, I used an sample image of a newspaper article regarding the 9/11 attacks which a bold header that says "US Attacked" and a subtitle that reads "Hijacked Jets Destroy Twin Towers and Hit Pentagon in Day of Terror." The five "prioritized terms" created by the tool were "United States history," "High rise buildings," "Aircraft accidents," "Jet aircraft," and "Air traffic control," which all seem like relevant terms. On a scale to four, the term "United States history" was rated the highest at a three, "High rise buildings" and "Aircraft accidents" were rated at a two, while "Jet aircraft" and "Air traffic control" were rated at a one. 

In the content results for this search, the tool did tend to show broadness and inaccuracy in finding relevant articles in correspondence to the prioritized terms. Through multiple pages of results, majority of the content relates to general aviation with other unrelevant content, including recurring results regarding China's aircraft production, which diverts from the concepts of "United States history" and "Aircraft accidents" that are more relevant to a 9/11 article. Therefore, if you were looking to find a more nuanced aspect of a specific topic such as 9/11, this tool would not be of great use. 

 The biggest strength of this tool is that it functions well and is very easy to use. The convenience factor of being able to drag or upload a document and get curated auto-generated content makes it a handy resource. However, despite the adding term feature, the inability of being able to fully dictate the search engine makes the resulting content open-ended and often unrelevant. A feature that could enhance this tool would be if the user could select articles which are relevant to them, and the search engine would adjust its results to present more articles that are of similar content.
